# lita-dogebomb

**lita-dogebomb** is a handler for [Lita](https://github.com/jimmycuadra/lita) that displays an arbitrary number of images of doges, via [http://dogeme.rowanmanning.com](http://dogeme.rowanmanning.com/).

Sometimes you'd just rather see an array of doges than whatever else is currently in chat.

Inspired heavily by (more or less copy-pasted from) [lita-pugbomb](https://github.com/killpack/lita-pugbomb).

## Installation

Add `lita-dogebomb` to your Lita instance's Gemfile:
``` ruby
gem "lita-dogebomb"
```

### Usage
`Lita: doge me` - display a single doge.

`Lita: doge bomb` - display five doges. Alternate syntax: `Lita: dogebomb`

`Lita: doge bomb n` - display n doges, where n is an integer.

`Lita: how many doges are there` - you can figure it out
